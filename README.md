## Objective
List species detected in water samples from the Nunavut.

## Summary
The Northern Hudson Bay (NHB) narwhal (Monodon monoceros) population is geographically and
genetically distinct and represents a vital cultural and subsistence resource for Inuit communities in
Nunavut. While aerial surveys provide abundance estimates for population models and sustainable
harvest limits, complementary approaches are needed to expand spatial and temporal monitoring in the
rapidly changing Arctic. Here, we demonstrate the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect narwhals
and co-occurring taxa in Arctic waters. Opportunistic water samples collected during a subsistence hunt
revealed narwhal eDNA alongside multiple fish and marine mammal species, providing ecological context
unavailable from aerial surveys. We further show differences in assay specificity: the MiFish-U assay
predominantly amplified narwhal DNA, whereas the 12S160 assay more effectively characterized fish
DNA, including Arctic staghorn sculpin (Microcottus sellaris), a genus difficult to distinguish genetically
and potentially representing an undescribed Arctic species. Our results highlight eDNA as a minimally
invasive tool that simultaneously confirms species presence and characterizes associated communities,
offering novel insights into species co-occurrence and prey assemblages. Incorporating eDNA into longterm
monitoring frameworks can strengthen conservation and management of narwhals while advancing
biodiversity assessment in Arctic marine systems.
